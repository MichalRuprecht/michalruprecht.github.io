      <h3>My name is Michal Ruprecht and I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan and beat reporter at <i>The Michigan Daily</i>. <i>The Michigan Daily</i> is the only daily newspaper in Washtenaw County and Ann Arbor with a circulation of 7,500. I manage and write content for the research section of the paper. I've been a student journalist since freshman year of high school, which makes this my sixth year as a student journalist. Throughout the years, I've learned the importance of student journalism and our role as watchdogs and storytellers. This portfolio is a manifest of what I have learned and how I've evolved. I'm a National Scholastic Press Association Honor Roll Student Journalist and I've received individual Michigan Interscholastic Press Association awards for my news and feature writing.</h3>
