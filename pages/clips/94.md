Michal Ruprecht's medical school friends can't stop talking about The Pitt.

Michal's the Stanford Global Health Media Fellow at NPR, as well as a fourth-year med student. And it's not just his friend group that's watching. Health care experts he spoke to said The Pitt, a medical drama set in a fictional Pittsburgh hospital emergency department, is perhaps the most medically accurate show that's ever been created.

So what about The Pitt makes it so accurate… and does the second season hold up as well as the first? Michal joins Short Wave to discuss.
