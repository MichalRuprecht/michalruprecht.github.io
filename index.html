            My name is Michal Ruprecht. I am a metro Detroit-based <b>health</b> and <b>science freelance journalist</b>.

            <br><br>I am the son of immigrants who fled an oppressive political system, where the freedom of the press was nonexistent. I grew up in the borough of Queens, N.Y., in a community that oftentimes avoided the doctor’s office because of historical injustices.

            <br><br>As a former ESL student, I began reporting for my high school newspaper to improve my English. But the experience morphed into something more than a writing class — a platform for me to write disruptive stories that contribute to improved scientific and medical understanding among medically-underserved communities like the one I grew up in.

            <br /><br />Most recently, I took my passion for storytelling to <b>MedPage Today</b>, where I supported coverage of cardiology and neurology research. I covered ground-breaking studies on transgender youth and teen vaping. I also published a two-month-long investigation about the pervasive culture of piracy among medical students. My stories were featured on the front pages of the American Medical Association and Cleveland Clinic email newsletters. In addition to writing, I helped manage the Twitter account for the cardiology section (@MedPageCardio) and increased user engagement. I currently serve on the board of The Lab, MedPage Today’s student advisory board.

            <br /><br />I also reported for <b>The Nation's Health</b>, a publication of the American Public Health Association. I covered the pandemic, healthcare disparities, the public health workforce and National Public Health Week, a week-long event hosted nationwide. I also led coverage of a 4,000-page study from the United Nations about climate change.

            <br /><br />At the University of Michigan, I worked on three impactful investigations about alleged medical malpractice, abuse in research and COVID-19 violations in a restaurant as a <b>beat reporter</b> and <b>assistant editor</b> at <b>The Michigan Daily</b>, my school's independent newspaper. Each investigation spanned four to eight months and one was published. My article led to an improved culture and anonymous reporting system in an academic department. I also led coverage of a ​​conjoined twin separation (the first of its kind in the state of Michigan), the development of a universal flu vaccine and the adoption of telehealth during the pandemic. Beyond The Daily, I told the stories of families and patients with epilepsy who began the keto diet to treat their symptoms. I co-created a podcast episode highlighting their journeys.

            <br /><br />I am a first-year M.D. student at <b>Wayne State University</b> broadly interested in neurology. I received a B.S. in Neuroscience from the <b>University of Michigan</b> in 2022, where I leveraged community action and social change to partner with individuals affected by the Flint water crisis. Outside of work, I am passionate about brewing kombucha, <a href="https://michalruprecht.com/pages/ceramics">ceramics</a>, yoga, swimming, running and traveling. I enjoy listening to “How I Built This” and reading STAT's Morning Rounds. Find some of my favorite clips below.
