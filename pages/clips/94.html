<p>	Michal Ruprecht's medical school friends can't stop talking about The Pitt.	</p>
<p>	Michal's the Stanford Global Health Media Fellow at NPR, as well as a fourth-year med student. And it's not just his friend group that's watching. Health care experts he spoke to said The Pitt, a medical drama set in a fictional Pittsburgh hospital emergency department, is perhaps the most medically accurate show that's ever been created.	</p>
<p>	So what about The Pitt makes it so accurate… and does the second season hold up as well as the first? Michal joins Short Wave to discuss.	</p>
