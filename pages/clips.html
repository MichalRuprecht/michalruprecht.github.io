                My name is <mark>&nbsp;<b>Michal Ruprecht</b>&nbsp;</mark>. I am an artist specializing in BioArt and an M.D. student at <mark>&nbsp;<b>Wayne State University School of Medicine</b>&nbsp;</mark>. I began my practice in 2022 at the <mark>&nbsp;<b>University of Michigan Residential College</b>&nbsp;</mark>, aspiring to create pieces that examine the intricacies of structural biology and nature.
                <br /><br />I draw inspiration from the rich history of Michigan’s Great Lakes, human anatomy, trees, mushrooms, and yoga poses. I am fascinated by the binding problem of neurobiology: how our brain synthesizes conscious awareness through the integration of various stimuli. Through my work in BioArt, my goal is to contribute to public understanding of science, serving as a means to counteract misinformation.
                <br /><br />I am currently eager to initiate the planning process for a BioArt exhibit that delves into the intersection of misinformation in microbiology and human-made interventions. My current focus is on advancing my practice in sculpting, placing particular emphasis on human-made interventions, acknowledged for their imperfections yet remarkable effectiveness. This emphasis reflects my experience with the imperfect products yielded from sculpting. Alongside sculpting, I throw on the wheel and practice sculpting, coiling, and slab building.
                <br /><br />My work is currently exhibited at the University of Michigan Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and the Michigan Community Scholars Program. Additionally, my BioArt was published in my undergraduate thesis and garnered attention from the University of Michigan, which covered it in their publications. Find some of my favorite pieces below.

      <h3><big><b>A BioArt inquiry into microbial membrane dynamics of the fluoride (Fluc) channel</b></big>
        <br />Science misinformation has rapidly spread throughout America, oftentimes fueled by social media, elected officials, and conspiracy theorists. All Americans — including the youth — are struggling to decipher real facts from fabricated lies. To put it simply, Americans have been let down by institutions that should have cared more. Thus, developing better methods of science communication is vital.
          <br /><br />While preparing my undergraduate thesis, I created three ceramic sculptures of the fluoride (Fluc) channel, the membrane protein I studied with members of the <a href="https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/randystockbridge/" target="_blank">Randy Stockbridge Lab</a>. While most ion channels are composed of one main unit, Flucs have two. This feature is usually only found in membrane proteins that use energy to pump ions across the cell membrane. Flucs, however, do not use energy. Through this series, my goal was to communicate the protein’s unique structure to the general public.
